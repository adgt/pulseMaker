    "The two stack figures show a live plot of the parameters selected with the sliders. All amplitudes are normalized to have a max value of `1`, and the time axis is given in samples (i.e., it is independent of the time resolution of a given backend).\n",

    "\n",
    "As an example, consider changing the number of samples to `100`, selecting a `Gaussian` signal for the in-phase component with Sigma of `10` and Amplitude of `0.80`, and a `Gaussian Derivative` signal for the quadrature component, with sigma of `15` and Amplitude of `0.05`. These options should generate the following signal:\n",

    "This is acheived by readjusting the maximum allowable value of the quadrature signal $Q$ depending on what the value of the in-phase signal $I$ is. So, for example, if we select `Gaussian` signals for both $I$ and $Q$, and set the amplitude of $I$ to `0.8`, the maximum allowable amplitude for $Q$ will be:\n",
