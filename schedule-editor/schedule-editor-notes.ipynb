    "### Info about Schedules in Qiskit-Pulse (particularly, how the `.draw()` method handles them)\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `Schedule` is: \"A quantum program *schedule* with exact time constraints for its instructions, operating\n",
    "    over all input signal *channels* and supporting special syntaxes for building.\" It uses a ScheduleComponent common interface with `name`, `channel`, `duration`, `start_time`, `stop_time`, `channel_duration`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- From some examples I've ran, what I can see is that a schedule is a tuple of Tuples each of the form:\n",
    "(`start_time`, `Instruction`)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `Instruction` can be, for example `Play`, which is also a tuple applies a pulse to a drive channel:\n",
    "`Play(Waveform(np.array([0,1,2,3,...]),name='wave'), DriveChannel(0), name='wave_on_chan0'))`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A `Schedule` object (from `qiskit.pulse`) has a .draw method to plot the whole schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- This method returns `visualization.pulse_drawer` (from `qiskit`) which takes as an argument the ScheduleComponent (can provide channels to plot, a styling table, blah blah blah)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The pulse_drawer is also used to draw waveforms, so the first thing it does, is check the data type. If `isinstance(data, (Schedule, Instruction))`, then it calls `_matplotlib.ScheduleDrawer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `_matplotlib.ScheduleDrawer` has a `.draw` method that returns a `matplotlib` figure\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It prepares each waveform channel by calling `_build_channels`, which returns `schedule_channels`, `output_channels`, `snapshot_channels`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `schedule_channels` are a combination of `output_channels` and `snapshot_channels`. `output_channels` consist of: `drive_channels`, `measure_channels`, `control_channels`, `acquire_channels`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each of the channels above is ultimately an ordered dictionary of the form `Dict[Channel, EventsOputputChannels]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The way these dictionaries are constructed is by:\n",
    "    - getting the list of channels in the schedule (can be done with schedule.channels)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - looping thru the channels (`for chan in _channels:`), and creating a template for each \"type\" of channel. For example: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    if isinstance(chan, DriveChannel):\n",
    "        try:\n",
    "            drive_channels[chan] = EventsOutputChannels(t0, tf)\n",
    "        except PulseError:\n",
    "            pass\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "        - `EventsOutputChannels` is a class with the Pulse dataset for a channel\n",
    "\n",
    "    - After the template is created, each dictionary is populated by looping thru the schedule instructions, and then thru each channel of each instruction, and adding each instruction to the dictionary:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "   for start_time, instruction in schedule.instructions:\n",
    "    for channel in instruction.channels:\n",
    "        if channel in output_channels:\n",
    "            output_channels[channel].add_instruction(start_time, instruction)\n",
    "        elif channel in snapshot_channels:\n",
    "            snapshot_channels[channel].add_instruction(start_time, instruction)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The `.add_instruction()` adds the start time and the WAVEFORM if the instruction is PLAY, or the whole instruction (like phase shift) if it isn't. Here is the code for the\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    if isinstance(instruction, Play):\n",
    "        pulse = instruction.pulse\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        pulse = instruction\n",
    "    if start_time in self.pulses.keys():\n",
    "        self.pulses[start_time].append(pulse)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        self.pulses[start_time] = [pulse]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - The result of these last two steps is a dictionary channel (for example output_channel) of dictionaries that contain the start time and instructions (waveform or phaseshift) associated with each channel:\n",
    "     `{start_time1:[Waveform(np.array1),Waveform(np.array2)], start_time2: [ShiftPhase(blahblahblah)]}`\n",
    "     (this item above is an element in a dictionary of the form: `{DriveChannel(0):The_Dict_Above, DriveChannel(1):Other_Similar_Dict}`\n",

    "- The question is: Do I keep separate entities for plotting and exporting?\n",
    "    - I think the answer is yes. Otherwise, I need to extract the plotting arrays everytime there is an update\n",
    "    - It shouldn't be terrible since the schedule won't be interactive (in the sense that there will not be amplitude frequency, width, etc. adjustments), but it might be easier just to have:\n",

    "        - An array for Phase shifts\n",

    "    - As the user \"appends\" new elements, the Schedule object and the plotting arrays can be generated simultaneously\n",
